News for Waf
============

This file lists the major changes between versions. For a more detailed list
of every change, see the Git log.

Latest
------
* tbd

6.0.0
-----
* Patch: Recurse dependencies of dependencies before the dependency.
* Major: Change the default interpreter to python3
* Patch: Fix resolve such that it won't run twice when invoked explicitly.
* Minor: Allow resolve without configuration, by calling python waf resolve.
* Minor: Added registry for the OptionsContext - this allows us to build git
  helpers etc.
* Minor: Adding helper functionality for rewriting files. This is useful
  when releasing projects and some files need to be updated programatically.
* Minor: Added git checkout resolver which will reuse previously checked out
  checkouts, and thereby making the configure step faster.
* Patch: Fix dependency_node(..) function to work with unicode strings.
* Major: Upgraded to virtualenv 16.4.3. The option --no-site-packages was
  deprecated and replaced with --system-site-packages. Which is now reflected
  in the API to create virtualenvs.
* Major: Removed pip_local_download, pip_local_install, pip_install from the
  virtualenv implementation. Users might as well directly call run with the
  appropiate command.
* Major: Prevent creation of virtualenv in build folder
* Patch: Make the virtualenv clone shallow.
* Major: Remove the explict dependency on virtualenv. Instead we will
  automatically download the virtualenv dependency.
* Minor: Updated waf to 2.0.10.
* Patch: Hide the output of the mklink command on Windows when calling the
  create_symlink function (the output is logged when an error occurs)
* Minor: Allow persistant virtualenv
* Minor: Added capability to prevent git dependencies from pulling submodules.
* Minor: Added Context dependency_node() function to return a waf node to a
  dependency. Making it easy to use Waf's ant_glob(...) function.
* Major: Updated the create_virtualenv(...) function for virtual environments.
* Minor: Added the clang_compilation_database tool.
* Minor: Add symlink in source folder to the current build folder. The symlink
  called 'build_current' will point to Waf's build folder.
* Patch: Move recurse_dependencies() to Waf's execute_build() function. Since
  this is known to only be called once. This eliminates using the is_toplevel to
  avoid infinite recursion.
* Patch: Refactor symlink code into a standalone utility. This makes it
  reusable by other tools which need to make symlinks.
* Patch: Update to newest pytest-testdirectory plugin
* Minor: Adding override attribute.
* Minor: Added post_resolve.
* Minor: Use a version of python-archive which preserves file permissions.
* Minor: Added exceptions for accidental empty options.
* Major: Full rewrite of our Waf dependency resolve code.
* Minor: Support for new resolver options.
* Minor: Adding support for resolve.json files.
* Minor: Updated waf to 1.9.8.

Un-released changes
-------------------
* Minor: Allow arbitrary git providers in wurf_dependency_resolve.
* Minor: Allow optional dependencies that might not be resolved if they are
  unavailable to the user.
* Minor: Allow option arguments without the = sign for the options that are
  defined and used in the resolve step (--%s-path and --%s-use-checkout).
* Patch: Reversed dependency build order.

5.0.0
-----
* Major: Added wurf_options to allow the definition of options in dependencies.
* Major: Dependencies are resolved recursively in the ``resolve`` step.
* Major: wurf_tools was replaced by wurf_common_tools that loads the commonly
  used tools automatically.
* Minor: Updated waf to 1.8.14.
* Minor: Updated waf to 1.8.8.

  ``git submodule sync`` to update your existing repository.

4.1.0
-----
* Patch: Do not pull the dependency right after cloning it.
* Minor: Changed behavior of dependency resolver when choosing git protocol.
  Git protocol of parent project is used if supported, but falls back on
  ``https://`` if the protocol is unsupported. Protocol can still be
  specified through command line option.
