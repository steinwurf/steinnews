4.0.0
-------
* Major: Make resolved symlinks relative
* Patch: Improve the titles in the benchmark plots
* Minor: Added ``set_timeout`` and ``catch_up`` functions to encoder and
  decoder. This allows changing the timeout after ``configure``.
* Minor: Added/updated API to reset and iterate through the different
  performance counters.
* Major: Change the meaning of the --mtu option when running the Rely
  application in TUN mode.
* Minor: Support logfile output when running Rely application in TUN mode.
* Major: Update chunkie dependency.
* Major: Update bitter dependency.
* Major: Update recycle dependency.
* Major: Update endian dependency.
* Major: Update kodo-slide dependency.
* Minor: Updated Rely application to use flush and optionally flush_repair.
* Minor: Add documentation on content aware encoding with Rely.
* Minor: Add documentation on Rely's packet loss protection approach.
* Patch: Fix issue where encoder::flush_repair() would generate too many repair
  symbols for a given repair rate.
* Minor: Added a number of additional performance counters.
* Major: Remove the `symbols_encoded()`, `symbols_decoded()`, `symbols_dropped()`
  etc. in favor of performance counters.
* Minor: Adding performance counters for monitoring performance.
* Major: Update to Rely Evaluation License 1.2, and
  Rely Research License 1.2.

3.0.2
-----
* Patch: Fix issue with TCP in tun application.

3.0.1
-----
* Patch: Fix hello world example.

3.0.0
-----
* Minor: Added encoder::flush_repair() function for flushing repair symbols
  manually. Doing so force the encoder to satisfy the repair requirements all
  source symbols currently in the stream.
* Minor: Added encoder::stream_size() and decoder::stream_size() which exposes
  the number of packets currently in the stream.
* Minor: Added simple hello_world example.
* Major: Changed `packet_bytes` to `max_packet_bytes`.
* Major: Changed `packets_dropped` to `symbols_dropped`.
* Major: Changed `packets_decoded` to `symbols_decoded`.
* Minor: Added encoder stats which exposes `repair_symbols_encoded`,
  `source_symbols_encoded`, and `symbols_encoded`.
* Patch: Fixed a bug which caused the decoder to throw away useful data, making
  it far less effective.

2.0.0
-----
* Major: Added support for variable symbol length.
* Major: Re-wrote API to support timeout and decouple it from IO.
* Major: Update license to Evaluation License Version 1.2.
* Minor: Added CMake support.

1.0.1
-----
* Patch: Actually the initial release.
